# Array Algorithms

This folder contains C++ implementations of various array-related algorithms, primarily focused on searching and sorting techniques. Each file demonstrates a specific algorithm or problem solution, with executable files provided for quick testing.

## Contents
- **binary_search_algorithm.cpp**: Standard binary search implementation.
- **binaryS_in_Matrix.cpp**: Binary search applied to a 2D matrix.
- **Bs_nearly_sorted_array.cpp**: Binary search in a nearly sorted array.
- **divide_2_numbers_using_BS.cpp**: Division using binary search.
- **find_first_occurance_of_element.cpp**: Find the first occurrence of an element using binary search.
- **find_last_occurance_of_element.cpp**: Find the last occurrence of an element using binary search.
- **find_missing_no.cpp**: Find the missing number in an array.
- **Find_odd_occuring_usinig_BS.cpp**: Find the odd occurring element using binary search.
- **find_pivot_element.cpp**: Find the pivot element in a rotated array.
- **find_total_no_of_occurance_of _element.cpp**: Count total occurrences of an element.
- **Inbuilt_uper_and_lowerbound.cpp**: Demonstrates C++ STL upper_bound and lower_bound.
- **peak_element_in_mountan_array.cpp**: Find the peak element in a mountain array.
- **remove_all_adjacent_duplicatite.cpp**: Remove all adjacent duplicates.
- **square_root_using_binary_serach.cpp**: Find square root using binary search.
- **vector_of_vector.cpp**: Example of using vector of vectors.

## How to Use
- Each `.cpp` file contains a self-contained implementation. Compile using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ filename.cpp -o filename.exe`).
- Executable files (`.exe`) are provided for quick testing on Windows.

## Purpose
This collection is intended for learning, practicing, and reference for common array algorithms, especially those involving binary search and related techniques.
